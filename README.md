## âœ… Get updates

Datacore Explorer is a work in progress. To keep up with updates, install a companion plugin by entering this repo's URL in [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) settings > Add beta plugin.

The plugin only does two things:

1. Creates a note with Datacore Explorer in vault root when the plugin is updated.
2. Adds a command to the Command pallette to create a note with Datacore Explorer.

Alternatively, get notified about new releases: press Watch > Custom > Releases at the top of the repo. (You can configure these notifications to be emailed.)
