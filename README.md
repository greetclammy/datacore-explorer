## To do

- [ ] Search in file content (support for Obsidian search query syntax, like [Note Gallery](https://github.com/pashashocky/obsidian-note-gallery)).
- [ ] Strip all syntax in text snippet (like [Notebook Navigator](https://github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator/) and [First Line is Title](https://github.com/greetclammy/first-line-is-title)).
- [ ] Add option to skip first line in description (sub-option: only if it's heading).
- [ ] Highlight card on hover (show outline or enlarge it).
- [ ] Change image on hover over thumbnail (for notes with multiple image embeds, not slideshow).
- [ ] Add ability to limit number of results (like in Bases).
- [ ] Add ability to copy links to all results to clipboard (like in Bases).
- [ ] Add table view.
- [ ] Add feed view.
- [ ] Fix setting text fields showing custom outline instead of Obsidian default.
- [x] Show tags/path and text snippet in List view.
